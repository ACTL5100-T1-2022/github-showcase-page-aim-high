###Objectives of Analysis
 
-It is beneficial for a nation's economy to have a successful international football team. 
-A machine learning model is implemented for team selection 
-In addition to the allocated budget, our proposal leverages alternate streams of non-government funding.
-Revenues will be gained through matchday, broadcasting, sponsorship, merchandising, and prize money. 
 -The direct and indirect economic impacts were considered by analysing cash flows, effect on GDP, impact on industries and constructing a 10-year implementation plan. 
-The proposal also considers quantifiable and qualitative risks, appropriate mitigation techniques and monitoring metrics. Limitations of the proposal are also included.
